hello everyone, i'm new so i'm sorry if i am putting this in the wrong place, but I have been trying to flash my NES mini for 48 hours now, ive followed tutorials, ive followed reddits, and everytime i try to .add a custome kernal. or put in the retroarch mod, i get the error /can't unpack ramdisk'. its such a nightmare, and i flashed over my original dump folder and i'm sure if i just had the original dump, in a dump folder I'd be fine. also, everytime it goes to /dump/ the kernal when i put it in FEL mode again, it gets to done, and just freezes. no way out. 
could anyone help me? I really need to just get this done already and its this ^%$#@@#$ screwed up original nes kernal that got messed up. please help (u_u;)
